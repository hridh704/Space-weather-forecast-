## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is designed to run directly in the browser without any build steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser that supports ES Modules (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cosmic-forecast.git
    cd cosmic-forecast
    ```

2.  **Get a NASA API Key:**
    This project uses NASA's public APIs. To get your own free API key, visit [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov/).

3.  **Create a config file:**
    In the project root, create a file named `config.ts` by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp config.example.ts config.ts
    ```
    Now, open `config.ts` and replace `'YOUR_NASA_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual NASA API key.

    ```ts
    // config.ts
    export const NASA_API_KEY = 'your_actual_api_key';
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    Since there's no build server, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. For the best experience (and to avoid potential CORS issues with local files), it's recommended to serve the directory with a simple local server.

    If you have Python installed:
    ```bash
    # Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
